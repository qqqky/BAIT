# ABOUT THE PROJECT #
#
# multi-line descriptions are ok, standalone multi-line tooltips are ok, but multi-line descriptions should not contain any tooltips.
# just write everything on a single line
//[1]\\. The first idea of this project was to visualize the similarity/difference between hashes and use it for experimentation on hash collisions.
For this, the private key is known and is usually used as seed which is then mutated to provide different hashes and compared with original private key.
//[2]\\. Later on, limited support was added to search when private key is unknown. [[[tooltip: See QuickSearch tab]]]
//[3]\\. Now program includes multiple key support and ability to save them between runs.
//[4]\\. Note that while this program supports multiple search modes, none of them are based on any science, rather they are just a reflection
            of sheer curiosity, interest on the matter and manifestation of some ideas that have been itching inside for some time.
//[5]\\. Just like some online scanners, this tool also supports checking for exact matches.
            Difference here is that you can be offline while doing so and there is no need to trust any third party.
            Just doing exact match check is orders of magnitude faster, but it is also quite boring.
            Having a way to compare each check between each other, however, makes this activity more game-like and is more likely to hit that dopamine
            release more often.
//[6]\\. This tool can be used completely offline.
//[7]\\. This tool is open-source and free.
//[8]\\. This tool only supports Bitcoin addresses and only of type P2PKH (legacy type).
//[15]\\. Maybe someday, ability to output different statistics about the comparisons will be included, but there are no concrete plans yet.
//[16]\\. More notes to be included in later releases?...
