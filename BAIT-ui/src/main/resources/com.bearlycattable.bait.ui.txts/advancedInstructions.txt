//[1]\\. What is 'Advanced Search'?
    - Advanced Search is the main component of this program. The search results can be loaded, saved and merged with previous ones.
    - It spawns searches on another thread (there is a limit of threads depending on your machine)
    - For convenience, progress will be displayed in the UI for every running thread separately (see 'Progress' tab once at least one search is running).
    - Multiple PKHs can be used as references for heat comparison (unlike QuickSearch).
        Here, number of allowed reference PKHs is not limited, but is advisable to be kept at < 4096.
        For higher number of reference PKHs, the search templates cannot be cached and will result in uncached search which is a lot slower and much more compute-intense.

        The shorter the reference PKH list is, the faster the search will be (linear dependence, as long as list can be cached).
        So don't exceed the recommended max value of 4096, even so, maybe test it out with a smaller number of PKHs first, say, a couple hundred.

    - You can spawn multiple searches (each will run on a separate thread) with different parameters. Max number of concurrent searches depends on number of available processors on your machine.
    - Keep in mind the search won't stop until all iterations are completed.
        Search can be cancelled at any time, but its results won't be saved (results are only saved when run is completed).
        Results are saved in .json format.
        Old result .json templates can be loaded for creating a new search or for browsing results.
        Loading your existing .json template and choosing to save results back to it is OK, but only if you launch not more than 1 searcher thread!
        If you want to use multiple search threads and save all of their results to your original file, do this:
            1. load your search template (to which you will also want to save all results)
            2. choose SEPARATE save locations for each thread you are launching
            3. while threads are running, go to Progress tab and select 'Enable automerge' option.
            4. don't forget to provide the path to your original result template (the one you loaded in step 1).

            When all threads are finished working, the results will be safely merged into your template.
    - You can run multiple loops of the same search (after each loop, the seed can be adjusted to your liking).
    - 'Exact match' check can be enabled (it has no fixed constrictions on max number of PKHs allowed, but it is advisable to keep the list at under a couple of millions of entries)
    - Search keeps track of all possible heat comparisons:
        UHP - for "Uncompressed, Heat Positive"
        CHP - for "Compressed, Heat Positive"
        UHN - for "Uncompressed, Heat Negative"
        CHN - for "Compressed, Heat Negative"

        What does it mean?
            - All of these 4 different comparisons and their best results will be kept track of and updated as needed by the searcher thread.
            - For example, if a list of 250 PKHs is loaded, that means for every new key, the searcher will have to do heat comparison for a 1000 times (250*4).
    - You can browse your results manually by opening your .json file or by going to 'Results' tab and loading it there (by clicking 'Load' button).
        If the results don't show up, make sure the correct scale factor is selected (as results for other scale factors might not exist in your template).
        Default scale factor is always MEDIUM (also called by its numeric value -> 1.1).

        Note that by default, after loading the results, only at most 20 addresses will show up in the drop-down menu, but when you use 'filter' all addresses from your template are taken into account.
        If you still want to see all the addresses in the drop-down menu (for example, to make sure that BAIT is really seeing all of them), you can work around this by setting filter option 'Max results' to your desired number and clicking 'Filter Results'.

        For example, if one's template has 300 tracked addresses, they would set this number to >300 and, after making sure other filter parameters are not in the way, click 'Filter Results'. If template contains results for the selected 'scale factor' and 'Accuracy min' is not set too high to exclude some results, there should now be 300 addresses displayed in the drop-down menu.

        There is also filter option that filters by starting symbols of your address, called 'Pub starts with'. This option is useful if you are looking for a particular address in your template.

    - Example of Advanced Search functionality:
        We load our template and set multiple different searches each going on for multiple loops. When all of them are finished, their results can be merged (manually or automatically) into a single target file.
        Merge function carefully checks for collisions and will recalculate and re-compare points to only keep the highest result (actually, 4 results: UHP, UHN, CHP, CHN) for each PKH.

        Next time, the results from any of the previous searches can be loaded and continued from as needed.

//[2]\\. I only want to check my own list of addresses for exact match and nothing else, is it possible to run the search without all the heat comparisons?

    - This program was not created with that in mind, so you won't be able to do that very efficiently.
    - One workaround would be having only 1 address in your comparison template. This way heat comparisons will be
        kept at minimum.
    - You will still have to setup and launch your advanced search normally though.
