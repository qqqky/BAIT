//[1]\\. Welcome to the advanced instructions tab test. This will not require a new label for each sentence. However, we will have to use the width and height options of: USE_COMPUTED_SIZE. Wrapping is impossible in TextFlow component, so new lines will have to be used...
//[2]\\. Meow meow something advanced instructions test [[[tooltip: this is just as test tooltip*

a multi-line tooltip! Wow! ]]]
//[3]\\. Try hovering your mouse over these type of icons to find out more detailed information ---> [[[tooltip: Example tooltip with text]]]
//[4]\\. What is 'Advanced Search'?
    - Advanced Search is the main component of this program. The search results can be loaded, saved and merged with previous ones.
    - It spawns searches on another thread (there is a limit of threads depending on your machine)
    - For convenience, progress will be displayed in the UI for every running thread separately.
    - Multiple PKHs can be used as references for heat comparison (unlike QuickSearch).
        Here, number of allowed reference PKHs is not limited, but is advisable to be kept at < 4096.
        For higher number of reference PKHs, the search templates cannot be cached and will result in
        uncached search which is much slower and much more calculation-intense.

        The shorter the reference PKH list is, the faster the search will be (linear dependence).
        So don't exceed the recommended max value of 4096, even so, maybe test it out will a smaller number of PKHs first,
        say 256.

    - You can spawn multiple searches (each running on a separate thread) with different parameters.
    - Iterations are not limited, but keep in mind the search won't stop until all iterations are completed.
        Search can be cancelled at any time, but then its results won't be saved (results are saved when run is completed).
    - You can run multiple loops of the same search (after each loop, the seed can be adjusted to your liking).
    - 'Exact match' check can be enabled (it has no fixed constrictions on max number of PKHs allowed, but it
        is advisable to keep the list at under a couple of millions of entries)
    - Search keeps track of all possible heat comparisons:
        UHP - for "Uncompressed, Heat Positive"
        CHP - for "Compressed, Heat Positive"
        UHN - for "Uncompressed, Heat Negative"
        CHN - for "Compressed, Heat Negative"

        What does it mean?
            - All of these 4 different comparisons and their best results will be kept track of and updated as needed
                by the searcher thread.
            - For example, if a list of 250 PKHs is loaded, that means for every new key, the searcher will have
                to do heat comparison for a 1000 times (250*4).

    - Example of Advanced Search functionality:
        We can set 3 different searches each with multiple loops. When all of them are finished, their results
        can be merged (manually or automatically) into a single target file.
        Merge function carefully checks for collisions and will recalculate and re-compare points to only keep the highest
        result (actually, 4 results: UHP, UHN, CHP, CHN) for a particular PKH.

        Next time, the results from any of the previous searches can be loaded and continued from as needed.

//[5]\\. I only want to check my own list of addresses for exact match and nothing else, is it possible to
    run the search without all the heat comparisons?
    - Yes, make sure the following checkbox is ticked under 'Advanced Config' tab: "do only 'exact match' check".
    - You will still have to setup and launch your advanced search normally though.
